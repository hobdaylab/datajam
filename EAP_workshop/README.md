## This is a version of the codes from the previous workshop that will be used as part of the EAP workshop 2025 

The 3 files within this direcotry are:
- The jupyter notebook used to read data and generate the resulting MIDI file (num2midi.ipynb)
- The python script that contains important prepared definitions and codes that the main notebook will call (music_def.py)
- An example of the data that the notebook takes in to generate MIDI as the spectrum of C60 (C60plus.csv)

  Copy them onto your onedrive and open the notebook using CoLab to get started!
